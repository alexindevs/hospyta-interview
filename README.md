# Hospyta Posts Feature

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a backend API for a community feature in a cross-platform mobile app using NestJS, Node.js, and TypeScript. The API includes functionalities for managing posts, comments, and categories, with endpoints for user interactions such as upvoting and downvoting posts, adding comments, and filtering posts by categories.

## Approach

To tackle the tasks, I began by ensuring that my development environment and configurations were properly set up. This included setting up the necessary dependencies, configuring the database, and initializing the NestJS project. With the environment ready, I moved on to writing the code, starting with user authentication to secure the API endpoints.

My biggest challenge was modeling the complex relationships between entities such as users, posts, comments, and interactions. I carefully designed the database schema to accurately represent these relationships and ensure efficient querying and data integrity. By leveraging Prisma for ORM and database management, I was able to create and manage these relationships effectively.
